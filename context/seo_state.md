# SEO Analysis and Proposals

## Current Project State

The project is a tourism portal built with React/TSX. It includes several pages, such as the Guide page and various blog post pages (e.g. SustainableTourismBlogPost, CulinaryJourneyBlogPost, TurquoiseCoastBlogPost, IstanbulBlogPost, CappadociaBlogPost). The code is organized into small, focused files that are under 200 lines each, and the project follows a clear structure with separate directories for content, pages, and context.

## SEO Proposals

1. **Meta Tags**: 
   - Ensure every page includes unique and descriptive `<title>` and `<meta name='description'>` tags. Consider using a library like `react-helmet` to manage this dynamically.

2. **Structured Data**:
   - Add JSON-LD structured data to improve search engine understanding of content, such as organization, breadcrumbs, and article schema for blog posts.

3. **Open Graph & Twitter Cards**:
   - Include Open Graph meta tags and Twitter card information to improve social media sharing and visibility.

4. **Content Optimization**:
   - Use semantic HTML5 elements (e.g., `<header>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`) to structure content.
   - Ensure images have appropriate `alt` text for accessibility.
   - Optimize headings (H1, H2, etc.) to reflect content hierarchy and improve keyword targeting.

5. **Performance**:
   - Optimize page load times by minimizing JavaScript and CSS bundle sizes and using lazy loading where applicable.
   - Consider implementing an XML sitemap and robots.txt file to guide search engine crawling.

6. **User Experience**:
   - Ensure the site is mobile-friendly and accessible.
   - Improve internal linking between pages for better navigation and SEO optimization.

## Next Steps

After implementing these SEO enhancements, test each change by verifying the meta tags in the browser, using tools like Googleâ€™s Structured Data Testing Tool, and checking SEO performance through analytics tools.
