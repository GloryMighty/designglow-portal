          <p>Sustainable tourism is more than a trend in Turkey - it's a commitment to preserving the country's extraordinary natural and cultural heritage. From the Mediterranean coast to the mountains of Eastern Anatolia, Turkey is developing innovative approaches to responsible travel that protect environments and support local communities.</p>

          <h2 className="mt-8 mb-4 text-3xl">National Parks and Conservation</h2>
          <p>National parks like GÃ¶reme in Cappadocia and Mount Nemrut demonstrate Turkey's dedication to conservation. These sites not only protect unique geological formations and archaeological treasures but also provide sustainable economic opportunities for local communities. Guided tours emphasize minimal environmental impact and cultural respect.</p>

          <h2 className="mt-8 mb-4 text-3xl">Eco-Friendly Accommodations</h2>
          <p>Eco-lodges and sustainable accommodations are transforming Turkey's hospitality landscape. In regions like the Black Sea coast and Central Anatolia, traditional stone houses have been carefully restored as environmentally friendly accommodations. These lodgings use solar energy, practice water conservation, and source food from local organic farms.</p>

          <h2 className="mt-8 mb-4 text-3xl">Community-Based Tourism</h2>
          <p>Community-based tourism initiatives are empowering rural populations. In villages across Anatolia, travelers can participate in traditional crafts, agricultural activities, and cultural exchanges. These programs provide direct economic benefits to local communities while preserving traditional skills and ways of life.</p>

          <h2 className="mt-8 mb-4 text-3xl">Sustainable Agriculture and Wine Routes</h2>
          <p>Sustainable agriculture is another crucial aspect of Turkey's environmental strategy. The country's diverse climate allows for organic farming practices that protect biodiversity. Wine routes in regions like Cappadocia and Thrace showcase how agricultural tourism can support local economies while promoting environmental stewardship.</p>

          <h2 className="mt-8 mb-4 text-3xl">Marine Conservation</h2>
          <p>Marine conservation efforts are particularly notable along the Turkish coast. Programs focused on protecting sea turtle habitats, coral reefs, and marine ecosystems demonstrate a holistic approach to environmental preservation. Responsible diving and boat tour operators play a crucial role in these conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>Turkey's approach to sustainable tourism goes beyond environmental considerations. It's about creating meaningful connections between travelers, local communities, and the rich cultural and natural landscapes that make the country unique.</p>
